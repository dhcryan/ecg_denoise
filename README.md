# DeepFilter experiments and dataset split as in Arxiv

Our DeepFilter work is published in the **Journal Biomedical Signal and Control** 
[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809421005899](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1746809421005899 "paper") 

The main repo [https://github.com/fperdigon/DeepFilter](https://github.com/fperdigon/DeepFilter "repo") follows the last 
version of the paper where some changes on the experiment scheme were requested by the reviewers.

Since for us reproducibility is **KEY** on research, and we understand that some folks will find and read only the 
Arxiv version, we have decided to create the current repository that follows the experiment scheme described in 
the preprint Arxiv paper [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03423.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03423.pdf "paper") 

This repository contains the codes for DeepFilter a deep learning based Baseline wander removal tool.

This repository also contains other classical and deeplearning filters solutions implemented for comparison purposes.

The deep learning models were implemented using Keras/Tensorflow framework.

# Introduction

According to the World Health Organization, around 36% of the annual deaths are associated with cardiovascular 
diseases and 90% of heart attacks are preventable. Electrocardiogram signal analysis in ambulatory electrocardiography, 
during an exercise stress test, and in resting conditions allows cardiovascular disease diagnosis. 
However, during the acquisition, there is a variety of noises that may damage the signal quality thereby compromising 
their diagnostic potential. The baseline wander is one of the most undesirable noises.
 
In this work, we propose a novel algorithm for BLW noise filtering using deep learning techniques. The model performance 
was validated using the QT Database and the MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database from Physionet. We implement an Inception 
inspired multibranch model that by leveraging the use og multi path modules and dilated convolutions is capable of 
filtering BLW while preserving ECG signal morphology and been computational efficient.  

The following figure shows the multipath module using dilated convolutions.

The following figure shows the overall model architecture.

In addition, we compared our approach against state-of-the-art methods using traditional filtering procedures as well as deep learning techniques.
This other methods were implemented by us in python

The proposed approach yields the best results on four similarity metrics: the sum of squared distance, maximum absolute square, percentage of root distance, and cosine 
similarity.

## Reproducibility

For the present work two methods for reproducibility:

### Run DeepFilter on Google Colab

The simplest way to reproduce the published results is by using the Google Colab notebook. The notebook file displays 
all cells results from a previous run. If you want to run the codes by yourself just go to the Google Colab Menu 
"Runtime" then click on "Run all" please be aware that this will take approximately 5 hours.

**IMPORTANT: Due to constant changes in the Google Colab default libraries and runtime, the following link may not
work as expected. As the date 2022-02-10 the link is working, but we are not giving more support for it in the future.
To reproduce our work we strongly recommend downloading this git repository and run local, more info in the next section.** 

[Deep Filter Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S1HjkQnrA0EbEDJFr0D-6DAt62RCcP5_?usp=sharing)

The used Google Colab GPU environment will allow GPU acceleration when training the deep learning models.     
The code will automatically download the data from Pysionet servers and prepare it to be used. Then the different deep 
learning methods will be train. Finally all the results will be computed using the metrics and printed as a table. Due 
the randomness proper of this method the results may differ slightly with the published results.
  
  
### Download this git repository and run local
The firts step is to clone this repository
 
~~~
git clone https://github.com/fperdigon/DeepFilter
~~~

Then lets prepare the dataset.

If you are using Windows open Powershell using the cd command place yourself on  inside the repository folder, then 
execute the download_data.ps1 Powershell script using the command:

~~~
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File '.\download_data.ps1'
~~~

If you are using a Unix-like system such as Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, etc open a console in the path of DeepFilter code, 
then execute the download_data.sh bash file. 

~~~
bash ./download_data.sh
~~~

The next step is to create the Conda environment using the provided environment.yml file. For this step you need the 
conda python package manage installed. In case you don't have it installed we recommend installing 
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) to avoid installing unnecessary Python 
packages. 

To create the conda environment run the following command:
~~~
conda env create -f environment.yaml
~~~

Then activate the Python environment you just created with the following command:

~~~
conda activate DeepFilter
~~~

Finally start the training and the experiments by running the command:

~~~
python DeepFilter_main.py
~~~

This python script will train all the models, execute the experiments calculate the metrics and plot the result table 
and some figures.

If you have a Nvidia CUDA capable device for GPU acceleration this code will automatically use it (faster). Otherwise the 
training will be done in CPU (slower).
